 *content: energy in form of food, aqueous solution, mutation opportunities

//emergent properties: eventually there should be an ecosystem of cells, perhaps some are better at pairing, while some are stronger but faster

/* Overview:
 *
 * Actions:
 *  - Swipe
 *      - Pushes the particles
 *  - Tap
 *      - Combines two paticles together to create a greater molecule
 *  - Swirl
 *      - Congregates the molecules together to create
 *
 * Objects:
 *cells, crumbs, ripples to imitate fluid
 *note: cells should be animated transparent amoeba
 * Transition (to next):
